Underrepresented groups include, but are not limited to: African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, Filipinos, those with disabilities or from disadvantaged backgrounds, and those underrepresented on the basis of gender identity or expression or sexual orientation.

### Postdoctoral Rearchers
We are looking to hire recent PhD graduates (or graduating students) with training in Neuroscience, Physiology, Molecular Biology, Immunology, or Gastroenterology interested in postdoctoral positions in our group. Please contact Polina directly, attaching your CV, most important paper, and a few sentences on what you are looking to accompish and learn during your postdoctoral training.

### Graduate Students
Graduate students admitted to [MIT Materials Science](https://dmse.mit.edu/graduate/prospective/applying), [Electrical Engineering](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/graduate-program/admissions), [Chemistry](https://chemistry.mit.edu/academic-programs/graduate-programs/application-requirements/), [Chemical Engineering](https://cheme.mit.edu/academics/graduate-students/apply/), [Biological Engineering](http://be.mit.edu/academic-programs/prospective-graduate), [Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://bcs.mit.edu/academic-program/graduate/graduate-admissions), [Medical Engineering and Medical Physics](https://hst.mit.edu/applying-hst/applying-medical-engineering-and-medical-physics-memp-phd-program), [Physics](https://web.mit.edu/physics/prospective/graduate/index.html), and [Biology](https://biology.mit.edu/graduate/prospective-students/application-process/) should contact Polina and lab members directly.

Students seeking admission to MIT please reach out to the appropriate departments with the links above and apply to MIT. We’ll be thrilled to talk to you following your formal admission. Individual faculty members at MIT do not make admission decisions.

### Undergraduate Students
MIT and Wellesley undergraduates should check the [MIT Undergraduate Research Opportunities (UROP) website](https://urop.mit.edu/) for the available positions or reach out to Bioelectronics graduate students and postdocs.

Non-MIT/Wellesley undergraduates – we encourage you to apply into one of the excellent summer programs available at MIT (e.g. [Center for Materials Science and Engineering (CMSE) REU](https://mitmrsec.mit.edu/), [MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP)](https://oge.mit.edu/graddiversity/msrp/), [Amgen Scholars](https://amgenscholars.com/)). Following your admission, you can indicate us as a potential summer home.
