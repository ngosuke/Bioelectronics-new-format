Gari completed her BS in Biomedical Engineering from Bucknell University in 2021 and joined the Harvard-MIT Department of Health Sciences and Technology later that year. Previously, she worked on projects including biomimetic materials characterization and the optimization of fabrication processes for microECoG devices. She plans to develop neural probes to study topics such as the role of intestinal sensory neurons in the satiety response as well as food aversion behavior in Autism Spectrum Disorder. Outside of lab, Gari loves to bake, hike, and read/write poetry.
