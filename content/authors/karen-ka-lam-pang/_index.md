Karen completed her undergraduate degree in Life Sciences at the National University of Singapore (NUS). She also worked at NUS as a research assistant, studying synaptic plasticity in the rodent hippocampus. She joined the Bioelectronics group in 2021. Her current research focuses on the influence of the viscera on brain and behavior, as well as, the gut-brain communication in Autism Spectrum Disorder. Outside of the lab, Karen likes to play volleyball, go on long walks, and amuse herself in art museums.
