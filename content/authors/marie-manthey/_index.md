After successful Bachelor and Master studies in Biology at the Eberhard Karls University Tuebingen, Germany, Marie focused her PhD studies on neuronal adaptation in the auditory system. Her PhD work at the Tuebingen Hearing Research Center and University Tuebingen has provided insight into auditory stimulus-induced shaping of behaviorally relevant adaptation processes in the auditory pathway set in motion by the neurotrophin BDNF and glucocorticoids in different rodent models. Intrigued to study pathophysiological changes in developmental brain disorders in more detail, Marie joined the Neuroscience department at Tufts University, Boston, 2018 as a Postdoctoral fellow focusing on neuronal connectivity changes in autism mouse models with aberrant expression in the Î²-catenin/Wnt signaling pathway. She introduced a new experimental approach to visualize the aberrant neuronal circuits with stereotactic injections of viral vectors in neonatal and adult mice. 
Marie joined the Bioelectronics group as a postdoctoral fellow 2021 to dive deeper into the stimuli that can trigger aberrant circuit connectivity in the nervous system. She aims to elucidate the shared neurotransmitter pathways and signaling factors that drive the changes in gut and brain in neurodevelopmental disorders and to unravel the underlying neuronal circuits between the gut and the central nervous system (CNS) at selected developmental stages up to adulthood in different mouse models. 
Outside of the lab, Marie is searching for the inspiration for her next cosplay for the upcoming comic-con by enjoying Sci-Fi and fantasy movies, TV shows, books and video games.
