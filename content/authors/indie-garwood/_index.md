Indie completed her BSE in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Michigan in 2017 and her PhD in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics from Harvard-MIT in 2023. In her PhD, she translated multifunctional fiber technology to study cortical and deep brain neurochemical signaling in macaques. Her postdoctoral research focuses on how neurochemical signaling during ketamine anesthesia results in highly structured cortical activity and altered states of consciousness. Her postdoctoral project is a collaboration between the labs of Polina Anikeeva, Emery Brown, and Earl Miller. When she is not in lab, Indie enjoys running, thrifting, and taking her dog on adventures.
