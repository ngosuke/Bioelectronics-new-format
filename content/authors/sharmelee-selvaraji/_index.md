Sharmelee (Sharm) completed both her undergraduate studies (2018) and PhD (2022)
at the  National  University of  Singapore. She  has been  working  on  mouse  models of
neurodegenerative   diseases   since   undergraduate   years   which   includes   Parkinson’s
disease, Alzheimer’s disease and Vascular dementia. For her PhD, Sharm pioneered
the study on DNA methylation in a mouse model of Vascular dementia, an epigenetic
mechanism that reflects the gene-environment interaction, in her lab. She demonstrated
that   intermittent   fasting   is   able   to   slow   down   the   disease   progression   of   Vascular
dementia in a mouse model through modulation of DNA methylation changes. In the
Bioelectronics   group,   Sharm   is   excited   to   explore   the   gut-brain   axis   of   Parkinson’s
disease and investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of the disease.
Apart from experiments, Sharm likes to advocate science to the public in layman terms
through write-ups and public speaking/seminars. When not doing Science, Sharm likes
to switch to the arts. She writes Tamil poems, knits, listens to music, hikes and loves to
watch the clouds (nephophile).
