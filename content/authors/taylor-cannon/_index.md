Taylor completed her undergraduate degree in Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt University in 2016, where she became interested in optical imaging research, and pursued projects using light-based tools to monitor the metabolic status of cancer cells. She then spent a year with the Photonics Group at Imperial College London as a Whitaker Fellow characterizing microenvironment-induced changes in the fluorescence lifetime of metabolic coenzymes. Afterwards, she enrolled in the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology program and completed her PhD in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics in 2023, concentrating in Electrical Engineering. Her thesis work developed signal processing strategies based on light scattering theory and custom endoscopic hardware to improve the utility of optical coherence tomography as a tool for early cancer detection in the gastrointestinal tract. In the Bioelectronics Group, Taylor is excited to work on the development of minimally-invasive implantable devices for imaging neural activity. Outside of the lab, Taylor enjoys exploring new restaurants, running around the Emerald Necklace, and tending to her sourdough starter and cats.
