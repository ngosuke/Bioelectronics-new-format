Florian completed his B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in 2015 and went on to study Neuroengineering at the Technical University of Munich, graduating with his M.S. in 2018. He joined the bioelectronics
group shortly thereafter to study the interface between the brain and technology and investigate minimally invasive methods to control neural behavior. His recent projects focus on the use of magnetic nanoparticles and targeted delivery of neural transducers.
