Keisuke joined the Bioelectronics group in November 2020 and is co-advised by Polina and Prof. Robert Macfarlane in DMSE.Â He completed BS/MS in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Tokyo. After completing MS, Keisuke worked in the private sector as a research engineer for 5 years. His previous research was on inorganic functional materials such as sodium-ion battery electrodes. His current interests are in minimally invasive delivery of magnetic nanoparticles to target organs/tissues. Outside the lab, Keisuke enjoys coffee, photography, and time with his family.
