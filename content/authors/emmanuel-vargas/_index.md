After graduating with a bachelor’s in biology and Psychology from Gettysburg 
College in 2022, Emmanuel sought after experience related to neuroscience and 
neurobiology before pursuing higher education. Emmanuel is now a research 
technician assisting the Bioelectronics group at MIT. While his interests lie primarily 
in biological techniques, he still enjoys learning other techniques as well as 
expanding on his knowledge of other fields. When he’s not working, he enjoys 
working out, running, playing basketball as wells as occasional chess.
